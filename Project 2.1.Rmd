```

## R Markdown

```{r}
library(readxl)
housing <- read_excel("Housing (6).xlsx")
#View(housing)
head(housing)
```

##a.
First Candidate Model
```{r}
housing1 <- subset(housing, lot<8)
housing2 <- housing1[c(-4), ]
pow<-1/2
pricet<-(housing2$price)^pow
lg2<-lm(pricet~sqrt(lot)+bedrooms+garagesize+elem,data = housing2)
summary(lg2)
```
This was the final model in project 1 therefore it is the first model.

##b.
Second Candidate Model
```{r}
library(leaps)
regfit1<-regsubsets(price~.,data=housing2,nvmax=13,method="forward")
summary(regfit1)
```
